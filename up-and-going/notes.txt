Coersion
The process of converting a variable of one type to another type.

Explicity coersion

Converting a variable from one type to another can be done using built in methods.
Ex: var a = "20";

var aNumber = Number(a); // 20
The Number method is a global available js method, to convert a variable to a string.

Implicit coersion

When we are comparing values in javascript of different type, ex string with number
Javascript converts the type of left side variable to that of right side variable to match types, in loose comparison

var a = "90";
var b = 90;

if(a == b){
    console.log('a and b are loosely equal');
}

after implicit coersion 90 == 90 which is equal.

Implicit coersion is generally termed as error prone and hard to understand,
but it can actually make our programs better, if we learn the rules of implicit coersion.

Variables

They help us store information like string, number boolean primitive data types.
Javascript is dynamically typed which means a variable can hold any type of value while for statically typed
languages we can only declare a variable with single type, re assigning to different type causes compile time error.

Ex:
let user = 0; // number
user = "Software Engineer" // string
console.log(user);
